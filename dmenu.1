.SH DESCRIPTION
.B dmenu
is a dynamic menu for X, originally designed for
.IR dwm (1).
It manages huge numbers of user\-defined menu items efficiently.
.P
dmenu reads a list of newline\-separated items from stdin and creates a menu.
When the user selects an item or enters any text and presses Return, their
choice is printed to stdout and dmenu terminates.
.P
.B dmenu_run
is a dmenu script used by dwm which lists programs in the user's $PATH and
executes the selected item.
